1. Is Ruby statically or dynamically typed?
Ruby is dynamically typed, which is why you can change variable types quickly, and the types are checked during runtime and not during compilation. 

2. What is the request/response cycle for accessing a list of articles in a blogging application?
When the users interacts with a page and wants to access a a list of articles, a GET request will get sent to the URL, for example this can be "/articles". The server will receive this request, and then Rails will execute the proper controller action "#index", which will show a list of all articles, and this is based on the URL/controller mapping listed in routes.rb. The controller will then call on Article.all which will load the entire collection of articles from the Article model. 
A view is then sent to the user which will interpolate the instance variables to be able to display the list of articles. 

3. What does it mean to say that almost everything in Ruby is an object?

5. What is the difference between class methods and instance methods?

Class methods are denoted by def self.method_name

6. Is Ruby strongly or weakly typed? 
Ruby is "strongly" typed, and the way we know this is because an error will be thrown if you type "hello" + 3. In comparison, Javascript is weakly typed, and if you tried "hello" + 3, you would get "hello3".
